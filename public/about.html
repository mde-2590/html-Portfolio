<p>I’m Mark — a lifelong learner, builder, and explorer of all things tech. 
  I’ve spent years helping people solve technical problems, and now I’m leveling up my skills into development, cloud engineering, and automation. 
  When I’m not deep in code or designing systems, you’ll find me trading the markets, practicing piano, or working on new ideas that help people work smarter.
  My mission is simple: create, improve, and innovate — one project at a time.</p>
